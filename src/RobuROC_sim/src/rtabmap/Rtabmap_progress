These topics aren't sending data to the rtabmap node, with warning:

[rtabmap_viz-3]    /camera/rgb/camera_info \

why arent the topic names the same ? Could it be that rtabmap is looking for the wrong topic names ? -> tried editing the rtabmap launchfile to 


Launch command that doesnt work (data not received for 5 seconds error):

ros2 launch rtabmap_launch rtabmap.launch.py     rgb_topic:=/camera/camera/color/image_raw     depth_topic:=/camera/camera/depth/image_rect_raw     camera_info_topic:=/camera/camera/color/camera_info     frame_id:=base_link     approx_sync:=true^




-> no error but nothing shows still..


Problem with scaling between rgb and depth (with both rtabmap launch commands),
